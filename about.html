                    <div class="about-story-content">
                        <p>
                            My journey into software development began in 2022 when I was in 9th class. Coming from a middle-class family where my father works as a DIY maintenance technician and my mother is a homemaker, I didn't have access to expensive computers or coding bootcamps. What started as curiosity about how websites worked quickly turned into a passion for building applications that could solve real problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started with whatever resources I could find - free online tutorials, YouTube videos, and open-source projects. My first projects were simple: a basic calculator, a todo list app, and a simple blog system. Each project taught me something new about programming logic, problem-solving, and the satisfaction of creating something from nothing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The turning point came when I built my first web application that actually worked. It was a simple student management system for my school. Teachers could add students, track attendance, and generate basic reports. It wasn't perfect, but it was functional and people actually used it. This experience taught me that building software wasn't just about writing code - it was about solving real problems for real people.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also learned the importance of perseverance. Coming from a family where technology wasn't a career path, I had to figure out a lot on my own. But each challenge I overcame made me more determined to succeed in this field.

                    <div class="about-story-content">
                        <p>
                            By 2023, I was in 10th class and my skills were growing rapidly. I started exploring more complex projects and learning new technologies. I discovered Python web frameworks like FastAPI and Django, which opened up a whole new world of possibilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I built my first healthcare management system - a simple but functional application that could manage patient records, appointments, and basic medical information. It wasn't enterprise-grade, but it demonstrated my understanding of database design, user interface design, and basic system architecture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is also when I started exploring AI/ML integration. I built a basic misinformation detection system that could analyze text and identify potentially false information. The accuracy wasn't perfect (around 85%), but it was a real working system that showed my ability to integrate different technologies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also learned about the importance of project management and documentation. Each project taught me how to plan features, manage my time between studies and coding, and create documentation that others could understand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By 2024, I was in 11th class and had built several projects that I was genuinely proud of. I was no longer just following tutorials - I was designing solutions, solving problems, and building applications that could actually be useful to people.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now in 12th class, I'm working on more ambitious projects that combine everything I've learned. I'm building a comprehensive healthcare management system that can handle multiple clinics, manage patient records, and provide analytics for healthcare providers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've also developed a freelancer protection platform that uses AI to detect potential fraud in transactions. While it's not processing millions of transactions, it's a real working system that demonstrates my understanding of AI/ML integration, security, and user experience design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of my proudest achievements is a repository automation tool that helps developers manage their GitHub projects more efficiently. It's not managing millions of repositories, but it's solving real problems for real developers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm also working on a conversion optimization platform that helps businesses improve their website performance through A/B testing and analytics. These projects may not be enterprise-scale, but they're built with real-world use cases in mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The biggest challenge I face now is balancing my studies with my passion for coding. I'm preparing for university entrance exams while continuing to build and improve my projects. It's a challenging balance, but it's teaching me valuable time management skills.

                        <p>
                            As my projects became more complex, I started exploring ways to make them more intelligent. I wanted to understand how AI and machine learning could enhance the applications I was building.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started with simple machine learning concepts - linear regression, classification algorithms, and basic neural networks. I built a simple text classification system that could categorize different types of content, which became the foundation for my misinformation detection project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project introduced me to the challenges of building AI/ML systems. It wasn't just about training models - it was about data preprocessing, feature engineering, and understanding how to evaluate model performance. My first attempts achieved around 70% accuracy, but through iteration and learning, I improved it to 85%.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also experimented with natural language processing, building simple chatbots and text analysis tools. These weren't production-ready systems, but they taught me the fundamentals of working with text data and understanding how AI can process and analyze information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The AI/ML journey taught me that building intelligent systems requires patience and continuous learning. You're not just writing code - you're designing data flows, understanding algorithms, and building systems that can make decisions based on data.

                            My current focus is on building applications that solve real problems while learning new technologies. I'm exploring ways to make my systems more intelligent and user-friendly, always with the goal of creating something that people would actually want to use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've also become passionate about learning and sharing knowledge. I document my projects thoroughly, write clear code, and try to help other students who are starting their coding journey. I believe that the best way to learn is by doing, and the best way to improve is by helping others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My philosophy is simple: build things that work and solve real problems. I believe in writing clean, readable code, implementing basic testing, and creating documentation that makes my projects accessible to others. I may not be building enterprise-scale systems yet, but I'm building the foundation for that future.

                    <div class="about-story-content">
                        <p>
                            As I've grown as a developer, I've developed a set of principles that guide my approach to coding:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="about-philosophy-list">
                            <li><strong>Functionality First:</strong> Build something that works before worrying about making it perfect. A working solution is better than a perfect plan.</li>
                            <li><strong>Learn by Doing:</strong> The best way to understand a technology is to build something with it. Don't just read tutorials - implement them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Simplicity is Key:</strong> Complex solutions often create more problems than they solve. Strive for the simplest solution that meets your requirements.</li>
                            <li><strong>Documentation Matters:</strong> Write clear code and document your projects so others (and future you) can understand what you built.</li>
                            <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Technology evolves rapidly. Stay curious and always be learning new approaches and technologies.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            As I look to the future, I'm excited about several areas of technology and personal growth:

                            <strong>Advanced Web Development:</strong> I want to learn more about modern web frameworks, cloud deployment, and building applications that can scale to handle more users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>AI/ML Mastery:</strong> I'm excited to learn more advanced machine learning techniques and build more sophisticated AI-powered applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Open Source Contribution:</strong> I want to contribute to open-source projects and give back to the community that has helped me learn so much.
